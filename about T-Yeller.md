Hello I am Tyler(or T-Yeller) this is my first project on github.
I have done other projects in places like google script and localy sharing projects just to help my freinds.
I am a former FFL(First Lego Leage) programmer, I probibly had 100's of different versoins of programs for our robot to get one of the highest scores in Illinios.
we were the Twister Bots, we had fun, and I would recomend it to poeple who want to get involved and you don't even have to like a thing about computers!
One of my main goals is to use my skills and intelegence for the good.
but for now, I'm not sure what kind of small projects you would like...
so if you think I might be able to help you or others, just ask me at: tylercrandall02@gmail.com
I also have made games on some platforms in the past, like Ylands, check out the zombie game!
I also love to find ways to make somthing better, like remixing someones game, like this one simple block and ball game that I made(check the ball.html file)
